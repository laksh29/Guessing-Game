# Guessing-Game
This is a brain-game where you need to guess the number that the program has randomly chosen. 
Every guess would give you 3 outputs: 
1. YAYY... You guessed it right!
2. Number guessed is high... Guess again!
3. Number guessed is low... guess again!
Which helps you improve your next guess.

If you guess it right in less or more than 3 moves then its your luck that helped you win!!
